A BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE VENERABLE MASTER JIQUN
The Venerable Master Jiqun graduated from the Buddhist Academy of China in 1984.
Master Jiqun then further pursued his education, studying and teaching at Fujian Buddhist Academy and Minnan Buddhist Academy.
For many years, he has diligently pursued a Buddhist Education, placing equal emphasis on the study and practice of Buddhism.
Master Jiqun is the 10th generation successor of the Weiyang Sect of Chinese Zen Buddhism.
Currently he is undertaking the roles of director of Suzhou Jiechuang Research Institute of Buddhism, and the graduate study supervisor at Minnan Buddhist Academy.
In addition to these roles, he is also currently a visiting professor at the School of Politics and Public Administration of Suzhou University, the senior consultant and visiting professor at the Research Institute of Religion of

Xiamen University, and a guest researcher at the Center for Buddhist Studies, Chinese Academy of social sciences.
Master Jiqun has long been engaged in both the study and teaching of Consciousness-only (Vijnapti-matrata), Precepts and Disci- plines (Sila and Vinaya).
In addition to his teaching activities, Master Jiqun has actively devoted himself to preaching the Buddhist doctrines, frequently lecturing at universities and giving speeches to Buddhist groups locally and abroad.
Master Jiqun is a prolific writer whose published works include over one million words.
His various literary works include the titles Truth and Fallacy, Bodhisatta Ideal and the Gradual Path to Enlightenment, Life Buddhism Series and many others.
Inheriting the concept of “Life Buddhism” from the Venerable Master Taixu, Master Jiqun conceives of Buddhism as a source of “life wisdom”.
His principal desire is to help people

get rid of their misinterpretation of Buddha Dhamma and integrate the wisdom of Buddha Dhamma into their everyday routines.
In response to common difficulties which often arise in the initial study of Buddhism, Master Jiqun summarized “Tak- ing Refuge (Sarana), the Arousal of the Bodhisatta Ideal (Bodhicitta-samutpada), Precepts and Disciplines (Sila and Vinaya)., Right View, Concentration and Contemplation (Sa- matha-Vipassana)” as a list of five essential principles of Buddhist practice.
These principles represent a distillation of 30 years of his experience of learning and teaching Buddhist concepts.
For the aspiring Buddhists, these five incisive elements represent a shortcut — a means of directly reaching towards the goal of enlightenment.
Using these principles as a guide, Master Jiqun created the Bodhi Academy, an educational system organized around

three levels of studying Buddhism.
The educational framework provides practitioners with orderly guidance along the path to enlightenment.

## PREFACE

## 前言

In this world, everyone meets various problems.
In fact, life is a process during which problems arise and are solved continuously; a new problem emerges as soon as the previous one is resolved.
And this process keeps repeating indefinitely.
Most concrete problems are not too difficult to solve if we make proper efforts.
But when we think further about our life and reach the depths of our mind, we will inevitably meet some common questions in life — What is happiness? Who am I? Where was I from before birth and where will I go after death? What is destiny? What do we live for? etc.
These questions are also an eternal source of confusion for human beings.
If we fail to solve them, our mind cannot be truly peaceful.
For thousands of years, people have never stopped discussing and seeking for answers.
However, the keys to these life questions often come from our thinking, guessing, deducing, or limited personal experiences, but not from realizations of the truth of life.
Today, I would like to talk about these issues from the perspective of the Buddha Dharma.

在這個世間，每個人都會面臨這樣那樣的問題。
事實上，人生就是一個不斷製造問題和解決問題的過程。
一個問題解決了，新的問題又接踵而至，循環往復，不曾少息。
現實的問題，只要努力多半不難解決。
但繼續對人生做深層思考，觸及心靈深處，必然會面臨生命存在的共同問題——何為幸福?我是誰?生從何來，死往何去?何為命運?活著為什麼?等等。
這些也是人類永恆的困惑，如果找不到答案，心靈是無法真正安寧的。
千百年來，人們始終沒有停止探討和追尋，但答案往往來自思維，來自猜測和推斷，來自有限的個人經驗，而不是對生命真相的體證。
今天，我想從佛法的角度，談談對這些問題的認識。

## CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS HAPPINESS ? 壹 何為幸福
As we live in the world, our primary concern is survival, that is, the basic needs for living such as food and clothing.
This is a relatively simple requirement based on material conditions.
Once our basic needs are met, we turn to seek happiness, which is something everyone cares about and is striving for.
So, what is happiness? Is it material or spiritual? If happiness purely depends on matter, it can be quantified.
We may set up a standard index for it, such as a certain amount of money or types of conditions, and so on.
However, how is it in reality?

我們首先要解決的是生存問題，也就是基本溫飽。
這是屬於物質層面的需求，相對比較單純。
除此而外，我們還想進一步獲得幸福，這是所有人關注並孜孜以求的。
那麼，幸福究竟是什麼?是由物質還是精神所決定?如果幸福僅僅取決於物質，那就應該可以量化，可以總結出一個幸福的達標指數，比如有多少錢，或有什麼條件，等等。
可事實又是如何?
When they are poor, most people tend to place their hopes for happiness on improving their material conditions, which is the impetus that drives them to accumulate wealth en- thusiastically.
But once the original goal has been reached, except for some temporary satisfaction, the anticipated sense of happiness does not seem to take place as expected.
Hence, happiness is not necessarily the result of improving material conditions.

何爲幸福多數人在生活清貧時，往往會將希望寄託於物質改善，這也是人們熱衷於賺錢的動力所在。
但在當初設定的目標一一實現時，除了給我們帶來一些暫時滿足，預想中的幸福似乎並沒有如期而至。
可見，幸福未必是改善物質就能解決的。

What is indeed happiness? In my opinion, happiness is just an unstable feeling.
This unstable feeling has to do with material conditions to some extent, but it is more closely related to our state of mind as well as how we evaluate our own needs, which is the key to understanding happiness.
If we do not have the right attitude towards life, or tirelessly chase after material possessions, happiness will forever be a mirage beyond reach.
Therefore, happiness not only depends on the ful-fillment of material needs, but also lies within the heart.
To understand happiness in human life, we first need to right- ly understand the relationship between suffering and joy.
From a Buddhist perspective, life is suffering.
Many of us may not really understand this and then conclude that Buddhism must be negative and pessimistic, as we feel our life is not entirely suffering, but half suffering half happiness, or partly sorrowful partly joyful.
Then, why did the Buddha make such a statement?
In fact, Buddhism divides human feelings into five kinds, namely, suffering, happiness, sorrow, joy and equanimity.
Suffering and happiness are more present at the material lev- el, while sorrow and joy manifest at the spiritual level.
Our reason tells us that these five feelings are part of daily life and thus are unavoidable.
However, in the depth of our heart, who does not prefer happiness to suffering? In fact, seeking for happiness is the instinct of all sentient beings.
For thousands of years, humanity tried to rid itself of suffering and gain hap- piness.
But what is the result? We have attained a comfortable material life which was unimaginable in ancient times.
But have we eradicated our suffering and afflictions?
Buddhism considers that life is full of suffering.
This is not a description in terms of phenomena, but a judgement we cast on the essence of these phenomena.
That is, suffering is the nature of human life and joy is a temporary relief from suf- fering.
In reality, there is never any joy that has an essential nature.
By essential nature, I mean no matter when and how long we experience such joy, we should always feel joyful in any circumstances.
Can we find such absolute and unchanging happiness in real life?
In fact, any kind of happiness matches certain suffering.
For instance, when we experience hunger, eating food brings us joy; when we badly miss our family, we feel gratified once we are reunited; when we suffer from insomnia, we feel delighted if we get enough sleep.
However, if we didn’t experience hun- ger or insomnia, would we still be satisfied by getting food or sleep? In other words, it would likely become a source of suffering if we were needlessly forced to eat or sleep.
Only when we suffer from hunger or sleepiness can we feel happy when the pain is alleviated.
From this perspective, the extent to which we gain happiness is proportionate to the amount of pain we are relieved from.

Modern society is materially privileged and people have more means to relieve suffering than those in ancient times.
In the past, when people were apart, it was difficult for them to hear from each other again.
As time went by, the longing increased.
There is no doubt that the happiness of reuniting after a long separation was extremely strong then.
We can find many such descriptions in ancient poems and verses.
Nowadays, however, if we miss someone, no matter how far he or she is, we can make a call right away, or meet each other through a webcam, or even go to see him or her by plane.
Distance is no longer an insurmountable barrier, even oceans apart.
Nevertheless, since it is easier to relieve, the suffering caused by longing will not be as intense as it was in old times anymore.
Accordingly, the happiness arising from the reunion is lessened as well. Because we don’t understand the truth of life, we experience misery.
But people often don’t see this, and think that chang- ing the world is an effective way to remove the afflictions.
This biased view leads us to constantly improve our material conditions while invariably creating suffering for ourselves.
To some extent, the speed by which we create problems is much faster than the progress we make to improve the world.
Although people in modern society enjoy a high level of civilization, they live a tiring life and experience more pressure than their ancestors.
The reason for this is nothing but too many desires and afflictions.
This is the root cause of life’s suffering.
Only by eradicating harmful desires and afflictions from our heart can we finally remove the source of suffering and be liberated.
Other religions generally place happiness in Heaven and external salvation.
In reality, changing our environment is a passive measure, just like “changing the broth without changing the medicine”.
If the quality of life has not changed, the resulting happiness will only be short-lived.
Because confusion is still present, it will continue to generate troubles and create a ceaseless cycle of rebirth or Samsara.
The Dharma teaches us that only when we experience and verify the truth of life can we turn our delusion into enlightenment and transcend suffering.
Furthermore, Buddhism especially emphasizes self-reliance, which is the essential feature that distinguishes Buddhism from other religions.
In other religions, external power is stressed and believers hold that people can be saved if they have absolute faith.
In the practice of Buddhism, we mainly rely on ourselves although we sometimes seek blessings from Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.

Of course, it is not possible to solely rely on oneself.
It is also necessary to have wisdom and methods to attain enlightenment.
That is to say, we need to rely on both self and the Dharma.
Otherwise, we will be led astray by self-conceit.
The Dharma mentioned here refers to the path of cultivation taught by the Buddha, simply put, the Three Practices1 and the Noble Eight-fold Path2.
In Buddhism, the Buddha, the Dhar- ma and the Sangha are called the “Three Jewels”, in which we take refuge.
The Buddha is our model from whom we learn to improve our life.
The Dharma is the way through which we understand the truth of life.
The Sangha are our teachers

1.  Three Practices: Sila (Precepts), Samadhi (Concentration), and Prajna (Wisdom)
2.  Noble Eight-fold Path: Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Behavior, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration who instruct us to practice the Dharma.
    By taking refuge in the “Three Jewels”, we can truly achieve ultimate liberation, escape suffering and attain happiness.

## CHAPTER TWO WHO AM I ?

There are many mysteries in life.
Since ancient times, human beings have kept asking: Who am I? Where did I come from? Where will I go? These questions reflect the eternal confusion of human beings as well as the ultimate interrogations that no one can avoid.
Since we care most about and pay greatest attention to this “I”, our whole life is built up on the basis of “self”.
However, have we ever thought what really represents “I”? Only this physical body? Or only the combination of the five aggregates1 which enables us to speak, move, cry and laugh?

1.  Five Aggregates: Form (Rupa), Sensations (Vedana), Perception (Samjna), Mental Formations (Sankhara) and Consciousness (Vijnana)

The reason why we are afraid of death is that we regard the physical body as “I” and think that the passing or decay of the body means the disappearance of the self.
In fact, the physical body is only a precarious element and a constantly changing form in the continuum of life, and thus cannot represent the real “I”.
From a philosophical standpoint, “I” represents an intrinsic quality, with the characteristic of being eternal and indivisible.
However, our physical body is made up of many elements that undergo metabolic changes and development at every moment.
In today’s medically advanced era, many parts of the physical body can be replaced, even by using artificial substitutes.
Where is the independent and unchanging “self”? If we understand this principle, we will neither care too much about the body nor will we be so fearful of death.
Besides the physical body, “I” exists in two other forms: views and attitude.
We live in the same world, while simulta- neously living in our own inner space with our own emotions.
Most of the time, we are under control of such feelings as pleasure, anger, sadness and joy.
Why are we dominated by them? The reason is that these emotions are mistaken for “I” — “I like; I hate”.
So, we care about them, attach to them and further impart energy to them in our mind, continuously strengthening them.
In the end, we surrender to these feelings which can influence us for a long time.
Some people spend their whole life pursuing love; others are driven by hatred throughout their life.
In fact, many emotions, like malignant tumors, are just unhealthy development of life.
Although they exist inside of us, they don’t belong to “I”.
If we can observe these feelings with wisdom, we will understand that they are merely fleeting images within the heart so that we won’t be overwhelmed and controlled by them like puppets.
To recognize this requires us to examine our mind and real- ize the harm brought by self-attachment in our life.
In fact, self-attachment is the source of all our afflictions.
Anything we label as “self” can be destructive and make us indulge in such things as love or hatred, craving day and night or worry all the time even while eating or sleeping.
Once the label of “self” is removed, its changes will not affect us.
For instance,

numerous shocking incidents happen every day in this world, but only a tiny part of them will touch our heart.
In many cas- es, we may just sigh upon hearing an event and then discard it from our mind immediately.
Why? It is because we have not connected ourselves with those incidents.
Therefore, there is no “self” attached to them.
Self-attachment is the root cause of all worldly disputes and the reason why we have conflicts and are unable to stay in harmony with others.
In daily life, a person who is strong- ly self-centered can hardly keep positive relationships with others.
On the contrary, those who are less focused on them- selves and think more of others are generally popular and live a peaceful and joyful life.
Because they do not fear that the interests of “I” are threatened or worry about preserving “my” self-esteem.
If we stay far away from this ever-haunting self, we will be free of the afflictions that follow “I” like a shadow.
From Buddhist point of view, “self” is a misconception based on an incorrect understanding of the truth of life.
Neither the physical body nor our feelings are permanent and cannot em- body the so-called “I”.
Therefore, Buddhism puts forward the idea of “no-self”, which is the Buddha’s greatest contribution to sentient beings.
Many people may feel confused and even panic about it: if there’s “no-self”, what does this body that can speak and move represent? And to where will it disap- pear? Actually, what “no-self” denies is the delusions attached to “I” instead of the phenomenon itself.
There is a topic of inquiry in Chan School of Buddhism: “What is the original face before a thought arises?” Every day, we experience an endless succession of thoughts, mental forma- tions which arise one by one into our consciousness.
What is the state of life before thoughts manifest themselves? If we trace back further, what’s the state of my being before “I” came to this world? There is another important topic of inqui- ry in Chan: “What was my original face before my parents conceived me?”.
Through such inquiry and meditation, Chan practice can wipe out layers of attachments and delusions that cloud our mind and help us uproot false assumptions.

Knowing Yourself: this is the fundamental issue on which the Dharma focuses and it also is the central dictum of western philosophy.
Only by a thorough understanding of the truth of life can we hold the reins of our progress and become true masters of our existence.
Otherwise, we are merely slaves to our body and emotions, striving hard for food and clothing, depleting our life for happiness and sorrow.
More sadly, many of us not only toil in vain but also generate evil karma through this blind pursuit, which will result in continuous degenera- tion and suffering in the future.

## CHAPTER THREE WHERE WERE WE FROM BEFORE BIRTH AND WHERE WILL WE GO AFTER DEATH ?

In the infinite universe, the earth rotates constantly at every moment.
As the saying goes, even if a person sits still on the earth, he moves about 40,000 km a day.
As inhabitants of the earth, have we ever thought about where we were from before birth and where we will go after death? Can we live with our mind at ease without finding the answer? Of course, many people haven’t thought about this question.
Others might be too busy to think it over or have decided to sidestep this unsolved riddle by various means.
However, whether we think about it or not, it is a reality everyone eventually needs to face.
Our life seems so short against the backdrop of a long history and our life seems so insignificant in the vast universe.
If we look at the phenomenon of life from the angle of materialism, it’s hard for us to find its ultimate meaning — no matter how splendid our life is, or how much effort we have made, all will fall into ruin in the end and turn into dust.
However, we don’t have to be pessimistic.
The Dharma teaches us that beyond its limited aspect, life has infinite dimensions.
Life is small yet infinite, short yet eternal, fragile yet strong.
If we could perceive thoroughly the nature of our mind, we would know that every finite moment implies infinity.
Only by realizing this, can we find the ultimate meaning of life.
When discussing the matter of birth and death of sentient beings, we must touch the topic of samsara (the cycle of rebirth).
In ordinary people’s eyes, life begins at the moment of birth.
Yet, from the view of samsara, our current life is only an episode of a long span of lives, and represents only a relative starting point.
Before this current life, there was an infinite past; after it, there is an endless future.
Certainly, it is generally not easy for modern people to accept this view- point, but if we observe life phenomena thoroughly, we will discover that some phenomena that are hard to explain scientifically will be suddenly enlightening from the perspective of samsara.
For example, do we believe in a predestined relationship be- tween one person and another? During the span of our life, we meet lots of people.
We feel familiar with some of them and seem to have affinities at first glance.
For others, we still feel like strangers even though we meet every day.
For a remain- ing few, however, we might dislike without reasons.
Why does this happen? Many people may explain this by fate.
But people seldom think over where such fate originates and why we may have different relationships with different people.
If someone believes in samsara, he or she won’t be surprised at such relationships.
The reason is that relationships between people don’t just begin in current life, but originated from many past lives, in which they have left many traces.
In previous lives, some were our relatives and friends, and some were our enemies.
When we meet each other again in current life, these traces revive and compel us to continue our past stories of love or hatred.
Let’s take another example.
Each of us has distinctive talents or can easily excel in certain majors.
We may often notice that although we study as hard as others, the achievement may not be the same, or even with big gaps.
Is heaven unfair to us? Is our destiny playing tricks on us? Neither.
This is simply due to different starting points in each person’s life.
With a high- er starting point, one may exceed others with a little effort.
Someone lacking such an advantage may have to catch up with hard work, just as a slow sparrow should make an early start.
But what is talent? Although it is usually believed that talent is inherited from parents, many people’s talents, as a matter of fact, have nothing to do with their parents.
From the viewpoint of Buddhism, there are actually two systems in life, a physical system which is passed down from parents, and a spiritual system which stems from the accumulation of past lives and will continue to influence future existences as a starting point for the next cycle.
The two examples above can help us understand samsara.
But we also need to understand that apart from being reflected as life phenomena, samsara has roots in our mind.
Buddhism perceives that all beings reincarnate successively within six realms: Deva (Heavenly Existence), Manusya (Human Ex- istence), Asura (Malevolent Nature Spirits), Naraka (Hells), Preta (Hungry Ghosts), and Tiryagyoni (Animals).
These six forms of reincarnation also represent the different inner states of our mind.

For example, the Hungry Ghost is the ultimate degree in the development of greed.
An insatiable person shows extreme cravings and can never be satisfied.
When this mindset de- velops infinitely, it will result in a state of a Hungry Ghost.
The Animal Existence is a state of ignorance in which one lives according to its instinctive needs.
For people who seek nothing but food and sex, what is the difference between their life and those of animals that are busy foraging and breeding?
Asura is the symbol of hatred and narrow-mindedness.
The battles they are passionate about are both a display and an expansion of hatred.
When such state of mind is entrenched, one’s life enters the state of Asura.
We can see that the state of our life is the extension of some kind of thought process which gradually evolves as we grow up.
In society, people from different professions display different behaviors and bearings.
Scholars have scholarly temperament while entrepreneurs have an entrepreneurial demeanor.
Those different dispositions are a manifestation of different mentalities and the extension of inner thoughts.
So is samsara, which is the outcome of one’s inner mind rather than a constraint from outside.
The same principle applies to the life quality of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.
The infinite wisdom and compassion they possess were developed and achieved gradually through their past lives.
Where does our future lie? What is our destiny? The answer actually is in our mind and behavior at this very moment, in what we are thinking and doing now.
The current state of life is the outcome of accumulation from past lives, and the future state of life is the result of accumulation in this current life.
Hence, Buddhism emphasizes the efforts at the present moment, which is the key point in connecting the past and future as well as the focus of our endeavors in changing our destiny.
If we don’t understand where we were from before birth, our life has no roots; if we don’t know where we will go after death, we will have no destination.
A person who couldn’t find his roots and destination will surely lack a sense of security, which is a mentality commonly found in modern society.

How to attain a sense of security then? Many people have tried to gain it through accumulating wealth or purchasing insurance.
As a matter of fact, how fragile and vulnerable these guarantees are in a world filled with disasters and impermanence! Let our heart return to the present moment since the real security exists nowhere else but within our mind and behavior at this very instant.
As long as we can seize the present, we can manage our future and life path.
When we are able to grasp every present moment, what could make us worry or panic?

Do we have a destiny? If yes, who determines it? Other religions mostly believe that the course of our existence is laid out by a dominant deity or by some mysterious power.
Buddhism, however, holds the view that our destiny is the law governing life development, in which we ourselves are the driving force.
In other words, destiny embodies the cause and effect of life’s continuum and is the result of different thoughts and behaviors.
Certain be- haviors will lead to a certain life path.
Our behaviors encompass actions of body, speech and mind: body actions refer to what we do, speech actions are what we say, and mind actions are what we think.

Buddhism also believes that the causes and effects of what we do, say and think, permeate through the Three Periods of Time, that is, our past, present and future lives.
However, it may be difficult for modern people to accept or resonate with this notion from the heart.
Therefore, what I mainly teach now is cause and effect from the perspective of our mind and its immediate outcome.
We could temporarily set aside the notion of the causality of the Three Periods of Time, but we cannot ignore the spiritual causality and instant causality.
When we perform a good deed, or if the thought of being kind arises, the resulting blessings might not manifest immediately, but the inner peace and joy it brings to our heart can be felt right away.
Whatever we do or think leaves traces in and thereby brings strength in our mind.
It’s such strength that influences the course of our future life, because thoughts will form habits, gradually fix into a state of mind, and further shape our different characters and personalities.
Within our mind are a great many thoughts.
Some of them are positive and some are negative.
The only difference lies in their respective strength.
By letting our thoughts run freely and indiscriminately, we will likely fall under the control of self-attachment, whose negative power would take a dominant role.
As the saying goes, “a man that does not look out for himself is destroying himself”.
That’s because self-attachment is our instinct and we uphold it unconsciously.
The signifi- cance of practicing the Dharma is to help us adjust the direc- tion of our life path and turn passivity into initiative.
Thus, we can selectively cultivate positive mindsets, weaken and even- tually eradicate negative ones.
Where do our habits come from? They simply come from our repeated actions and thoughts, thereby becoming natural.
For example, we are accustomed to seeing certain people, doing certain things and eating certain foods on a daily basis.
Once our habits are fixed, they gradually become a lifestyle and shape our character.
Likewise, our character is an accumu- lation of habits that will gradually shape our personality and

determine the quality of our life.
If we reflect on this for a moment, we will find that many aspects of our character are closely related to our daily habits.
Our habits and character determine how our destiny will unfold.
Therefore, our destiny is not bestowed from heaven, nor is it attributable to chance.
Rather, it is a path paved by ourselves, or more specifically, by our behavior.
In Buddhism, the factors that determine our destiny are called karma.
Karma can be viewed as our life’s program.
Committing behaviors that cause a rebirth as a hell being is like making a program for entering into the realm of Naraka (Hells); conducting wholesome behaviors that cause a rebirth as human or heav- enly being is like making a program for entering into the realm of Manusya (Human Existence) or Deva (Heavenly Existence).
Depending on the programs we set up, we will enter different realms or life paths.
Therefore, changing our destiny requires us to start changing our mind and behaviors.
If we are able to do so, we are then able to change our destiny.
On the contrary, if we cannot change our current character and habits, changing destiny would be empty talk.
Our mind has two characteristics: the ability to make choices, and the ability to create.
It is mainly because of these capabil- ities that human beings are regarded as the wisest of all beings on the earth.
A desk is not capable of making choices, and nor is a house.
Animals are born with a relatively weak ability to make choices.
We human beings, however, have capacities for reasoning and abstract thinking.
We can not only choose and judge, but also create based on our choices and judgments.
It is exactly by virtue of these two characteristics of the mind that human beings have built a civilization of thousands of years old.
In the course of changing the world, the destiny of human beings has transformed as well.
From this perspective, the heart is the master of our destiny.
Unfortunately, more often than not, once certain behaviors be- come habits, the mind will unconsciously enter into an inertial course and be controlled by it.
It is not easy to initiate change even if we want to.
This is where we need Buddhist practice, and where the difficulty of the practice also lies.
Habits are deep-rooted because they have been accumulated over a long period of time.
Just like the gravity that holds us on earth, the power of habits is so strong that it is difficult for us to tran- scend and break free from this unenlightened state.
Once, a professor said that he wanted to learn and practice the Buddha Dharma simply for the sake of quitting smoking.

Having smoked for thirty years, he could not get out of nico- tine’s control, but he had to, because a medical examination had revealed a disease in his lungs.
The doctor warned him not to smoke anymore, or he would die shortly.
Of course, he didn’t want to die, but his struggle against nicotine’s addiction had exhausted his body and mind, and he hoped to solve the problem through learning and practicing the Buddha Dharma.

Such a motive in turning to Buddhism seems somewhat friv- olous, but it does tell how strong a hold habits can have on our mind and body once they are formed.
If we are not truly determined, it will be unlikely for us to make a change.
In addition to our determination, we also need to understand the law governing life development.
Only by observing this law can we really plan our future and change our destiny.

## CHAPTER FIVE WHAT ARE WE LIVING FOR ?

What are we living for? What is the value of living? These are important questions that none of us can avoid.
There is a reason behind everything we do.
We eat because of hunger, sleep because of sleepiness, and seek for love because of loneliness.
Doesn’t living need a reason as well? For ordi- nary people, it doesn’t seem difficult to find a reason for liv- ing, such as children, family or career.
Since they do not con- template life that much, any reason could be justified.
When thinking deeper, however, we would hardly be satisfied with such answers that represent the values held by most ordinary people.
Thus, for those with a deeper thinking about life, it is not easy to find reasons for living because the reasons widely accepted by the world cannot withstand close scrutiny.
Some reasons are important beyond doubt for some but are irrele- vant for others; or they seem to be indispensable in one period of life, while worthless in others.
Therefore, it is apparent that the reasons above are not the ultimate answers we are looking for.
Unable to find proper reasons for living, many artists and philosophers are depressed to such an extent that they choose to end their lives.
For people who treasure their spiritual life, it is not possible to live with their mind at ease if they fail to find a convincing reason for living.
From a deeper perspective, the values of life that most people are pursuing cannot withstand the test of death — however successful the career is, or however great the wealth is, in face of death, they are just as transient and fragile as bubbles.
When a career comes to an end, what is left of our life? Looking back into history, even emperors who had conquered and ruled the world for some time eventually perished and returned to dust.
Hence, all external possessions will vanish.
When all these are gone, it is their impact on our life that should be pondered.
Mencius1 once said, “Everyone could become sages like Yao and Shun2.” In the view of Buddhism, every living being in- nately has the same virtuous nature as that of Buddhas and

1.  Mencius: A Chinese philosopher during the Spring and Autumn period, who was, after Confucius, one of the most famous Confucians.
2.  Yao and Shun: Two capable and virtuous chiefs of tribal alliance in Chi- nese ancient history.

Bodhisattvas.
In other words, every living being has Buddha nature.
On one hand, our mind creates various afflictions.
On the other hand, it also has the ability to dissolve these afflic- tions.
If we do not develop such ability, we will be trapped in endless Samsara, because ignorance, like a perpetual motion machine, produces suffering and keeps us blindly drifting and being lost in the ocean of suffering.
The meaning of life lies in recognizing and developing our inherent virtuous nature.
Only in this way can we uplift the quality of our life and give ultimate and long-lasting help to all living beings.
This is exactly what Buddhism means by “enlightening oneself and others, benefiting oneself and oth- ers”.
In the view of Buddhism, life is made up of delusions, karma and suffering.
Due to ignorance that blinds our mind, we can- not see clearly the truth of life.
Without understanding what happiness is, we take suffering as happiness, running in the opposite direction of happiness; without understanding who we are, we cling to things other than self as the “self”, which causes endless pain.
Without understanding where life comes from before birth and where it will go after death, and what our destiny is, we are not able to make a right planning for the future, and nor can we set our lives on the right track.
Without understanding the meaning of life, we chase after insignificant short-term benefits while neglecting the true value of life.
We might lose motivation to live because we cannot find a justifiable reason to stay alive.
Thus, to find real happiness, it is of great significance to discuss and resolve these eternal ques- tions about life.




那幸福究竟是什麼呢?我的定義是:幸福只是一種不穩定的感覺。
這種不穩定的感覺，固然和物質條件有一定關係，但更重要的，是在於自身心態，在於我們對自身需求的定位，這才是問題的根本所在。
如果缺乏良好心態，或對物質的需求永無止境，那麼，幸福將永遠是可望而不可即的幻影。
所以說，幸福不僅是唯物的，更是唯心的。

探討人生幸福，首先需要對苦、樂的關係具有正確認識。

從佛法觀點來看，認為人生是苦。
許多人對這一定義不理解，並以此推斷，佛教必是消極悲觀的。
因為在我們的感覺中，並非一味的苦，而是苦樂參半、悲喜交集。
那麼，佛陀為什麼會有這樣的歸納呢?
其實，佛教也將人的感覺分為五種，分別為苦、樂、憂、喜、舍。
其中，苦和樂偏於物質層面，憂和喜偏於精神層面。
雖然理智也告訴我們:苦樂憂喜都是無法避免的人生常態。
但在內心，誰又不是趨樂而避苦呢?事實上，這也是一切眾生的本能。
人類的五千年文明，同樣是在幫助我們擺脫痛苦，獲得快樂。
但結果又是如何?我們有了古人難以想象的豐裕生活，但痛苦就此解決了嗎?煩惱就此消失了嗎?
可見，佛教所說的人生是苦，並不是就現象而言，而是透過現象所作的本質判斷——苦是人生本質，而快樂只是對痛苦的一種緩解。
現實中，沒有哪種快樂是具有本質性的。
所謂本質，也就是說，這種快樂無論什麼時候享受，也無論享受多長時間，它都是快樂的。
我們能找到這樣一種絕對、不變的快樂嗎?
事實上，任何一種快樂都有某種痛苦與之對應。
當我們被饑渴之苦折磨時，吃飯會成為快樂;當我們被思念之苦纏繞時，親人相見會成為快樂;當我們夜不成寐時，安然入睡會成為快樂。
如果去掉饑渴、失眠這些前提，吃飯和睡覺會成為快樂嗎?當我們不想吃卻不得不吃，不想睡卻不得不睡的時候，同樣的事立刻就轉為痛苦了。
只有當我們需要吃飯、睡覺並為之所苦時，才會因為這種痛苦得到緩解而產生快樂。
從這個層面來說，痛苦有多少，由緩解痛苦所帶來的快樂就有多少。

現代社會物質豐富，也比古人有了更多緩解痛苦的途徑。
古人離別時，天各一方，音訊渺茫，這種思念因難以解決而與日俱增。
一旦相見，由此產生的喜悅可謂強烈之極，這在古代詩文中有大量描寫。
但現在我們想念一個人時，可以立即撥通電話。
如果覺得只聞其聲不夠，還可通過視頻相見。
再或者，買張機票就能很快見面，哪怕遠隔重洋，也不再是無法逾越
何爲幸福的障礙。
但正因為易於緩解，這種由相思帶來的痛苦就很膚淺，很有限。
相應的，所產生的快樂也很膚淺，很有限。

因為不瞭解生命真相，我們才會產生諸多煩惱。
但人們往往看不到這一點，以為改變世界才是解決痛苦的有效途徑。
這一定位的偏差，使得我們在改善物質條件的同時，又在不斷製造煩惱。
甚至可以說，製造問題的速度遠比改善世界的進程更快。
所以，今天的人雖然享有高度文明，卻比古人活得更累，壓力更大。
原因無他，就在於欲望太多，煩惱太多，這也是人生之苦的根本。
惟有消除內心的惡性需求及煩惱，才能從源頭解決痛苦，成就解脫自在的人生。

其他宗教往往將幸福寄託于天堂，寄託於外在拯救。
其實，改變環境只是換湯不換藥的被動舉措。
倘若生命品質不曾改變，由此帶來的安樂只是暫時的。
因為生命的迷惑還在，就會源源不斷地製造煩惱，製造輪回。
佛教認為，惟有體證生命真相，才能從根本上轉迷為悟，超越痛苦。
此外，佛教還特別強調自力，即自身努力，這也是佛教區別於其他宗教的主要特徵之一。
其他宗教主要強調他力，只要具有信仰，就能因此得到救贖。
而在佛教修行中，雖然也依靠佛菩薩的加持力，但主力卻是自己。
當然，僅僅依靠自己還不行，還需要有智慧，有
方法，所謂“以己為舟，以法為舟”。
否則，往往會走上自以為是的歧路。
這裡所說的法，就是佛陀告訴我們的修行之道，簡單地說，就是三學八正道。
佛教以“佛、法、僧”為三寶，為皈依對象。
其中，佛是我們改善生命的榜樣，法是認識生命真相的方法，僧是指導我們使用方法的導師。
由依止佛法僧三寶，而能究竟地解脫自在、離苦得樂。

## 貳 我是誰

生命有很多不解之謎。
古往今來，人們不停地追問著:我是誰?我從哪裡來?我到哪裡去?這是人類永恆的困惑，也是每個人無法逃避的終極問題。
因為我們最在乎、最關注的就是這個“我”。
我們的整個生活，基本都是以自我為中心而建立。
但我們是否想過:究竟什麼代表著我?僅僅是這個身體嗎?僅僅是眼前這個會說會動、會哭會笑的五蘊身嗎?
我是誰人們之所以害怕死亡，原因就是將這個身體當做是我，以為身體敗壞就意味著“我”的毀滅。
其實，色身只是生命延續過程中的一個朝不保夕的片斷，一種不斷改變的形式，並不能代表真正的“我”。
從哲學定義來說，“我”代表著生命的本質，是永恆且不可分割的。
但身體只是由眾多元素構成，刹那刹那處於新陳代謝中，處於發展變化中。
而在今天這個醫學發達的時代，身體的很多零件還可以更換組裝，甚至使用人工替代品，其中哪有什麼獨存、不變的“我”呢?如果瞭解其中原理，我們對身體就不會那麼在乎，對死亡就不會那麼恐懼了。

身體而外，“我”的存在還體現於兩方面:一是觀念，一是心態。
我們生活在共同的世界，但同時又活在自己的世界，活在自己的情緒中。
很多時候，還會被這些喜怒哀樂左右著，無法自主。
我們為什麼會被其主宰?原因就是把這些情緒誤以為是“我”——“我喜歡，我討厭”，於是就會在乎，就會執著，進而不斷將心靈能量投射其中，不斷強化這些情緒。
最終將主權拱手相讓，使某些情緒長時間地影響我們。
生活中，有人一生追尋愛情，也有人一生被仇恨驅使。
其實，很多情緒只是內心的惡性腫瘤，只是生命的不良發展。

雖然生長在我們心中，卻並不屬於“我”的一部分。
倘能以智慧進行觀照，認清這些情緒不過是內心漂浮的影像，就不會一頭栽入其中，成為被操縱的傀儡。

這就需要對自我進行審視，認清“我執”給生命帶來的危害。
事實上，一切煩惱皆因“我執”而起。
任何一種東西，只要貼上自我的標籤，對我們就會具有殺傷力，就會讓人愛，讓人恨，讓人朝思暮想，寢食難安。
一旦將自我的標籤去除，它的變化就不會對我們產生什麼影響了。
在這個世間，每天要發生很多驚天動地的事，但真正使我們為之心動的未必有萬千分之一。
很多時候，我們只是隨之感慨一下，就迅速拋在腦後。
為什麼?就是因為我們沒有將自己和那些事切實聯繫起來，沒有對此產生“我執”。

“我執”還是世間一切是非紛爭的根源，是我們和他人相互抵觸、難以和諧的原因所在。
生活中，一個自我意識過強，處處以“我”為中心的人，必定不會有融洽的人際關係。
反之，那些淡化自我、處處為他人著想的人，不僅深受大眾歡迎，自己也能安樂自在。
因為他們不必害怕“我”的利益受損，擔心“我”的自尊受挫。
遠離這個處處作祟的“我”，也就遠離了那些與“我”形影相隨的煩惱。

從佛教角度來說，“自我”正是有情最大的誤解，是我們因為不瞭解生命真相而產生的錯誤設定。
無論身體還是情緒，都不具有永恆不變的內涵，都不能代表所謂的“我”。
所以，佛教提出“無我”的思想。
這也是佛陀對眾生最大的貢獻。
或許不少人會覺得費解，甚至對此感到恐懼:如果“無我”，那現在這個會說會動的又是什麼?又會消失何方?其實，“無我”所否定的，只是加諸於“我”的錯覺，而非現象本身。
禪宗有個話頭是:“一念未生前本來面目是什麼?”
我們每天都在不絕如縷的思緒中，在一念接一念的意識活動中。
當這些念頭尚未生起之前，生命是一種什麼狀態?再往前追朔:來到這個世界前，“我”又是以什麼狀態存在?所謂“父母未生前本來面目是什麼”，這也是禪宗另一個重要的話頭。
禪宗的修行，正是通過這樣一種追尋，將遮蔽內心的妄執層層掃蕩，將現有的錯誤設定逐步瓦解。

認識自己——這是佛法關注的根本問題，也是西方哲學的最高名言。
惟有透徹生命真相，我們才能把握前進之舵，成為生命的真正主人。
否則，只能是這個色身或情緒的奴隸，為他的衣食奔忙不休，為他的喜怒耗盡生命。
更悲哀的是，很多人不僅勞而無功，還會由此造作惡業，使未來繼續沉淪，繼續受苦。

## 叁生從何來，死往何去

茫茫宇宙中，地球時刻都在不停運動，所謂“坐地日行八萬裏”。
那麼，居住在地球上的我們，來自何方，又去向何方?如果找不到答案，我們能活得踏實嗎?當然，不少人未必會想這個問題，或者事情太多而沒時間去想，再或者，用種種方法來轉移這個無法解決的疑問。
但不論我們想不想，這是每個人最終需要面對的現實。

生從何來，死往何去在歷史長河中，我們的一生是如此短暫;在浩淼太空中，我們的生命又是如此渺小。
如果從唯物論的角度看待生命現象，我覺得，實在看不出生命的終極意義。
不論有過多少輝煌，也不論付出多少努力，最終都是趨於毀滅，都是化為塵土。
但我們不必因此悲觀，佛法告訴我們:在有限的層面之外，生命還有其無限的層面。
生命既是渺小，也是無限的;既是短暫的，也是恒久的;既是脆弱的，也是強健的。
倘能透徹心的本質，就會瞭解，每個有限的當下都是無限。
認識這一層面，我們才能找到人生的終極意義。

探討有情的生死，必然涉及生命的輪回。
在一般人看來，生命就是從呱呱落地開始。
而從輪回的眼光來看，今生只是生命長卷中的一個章節，只是其中一個相對的開始。
在它之前，有著無窮的過去;在它之後，又有著無盡的未來。
當然，現代人往往不易接受這一觀點，但只要對生命現象全面觀察，我們會發現，某些用科學難以解釋的現象，若從輪回角度來看，就會豁然開朗。

比如，我們是否相信人和人之間存在緣分?在這個世間，我們會和很多人相識相遇。
有些人，我們會一見如故;有些人，天天見面也會視同陌路;還有些人，我們卻會毫無理由地心生厭惡。
原因何在?很多人會說:這是緣分。
但很少有人進一步思考:緣分又從何而來?為什麼我們和不同的人會有不同的緣分?如果相信輪回，對緣分就不會感到奇怪。
因為人與人之間的關係並非始於今生，還有許多前生帶來的烙印。
在過去生，有些曾是我們的親朋故友，有些則是我們的冤家仇敵。
當彼此在今生再度相遇，這種烙印就復蘇了，並驅使我們將往昔的愛恨情仇繼續演繹下去。

再如，每個人都有不同的天賦，有自己學起來容易上手的專業。
我們常常可以看到，在學習中付出同樣努力，未必會有同樣成果，還可能相距甚遠。
是上天不公嗎?是命運捉弄嗎?都不是，只是因為生命起點不同。
起點高的，稍加努力就能領先於人。
而起點低的，惟以“笨鳥先飛”作為彌補。
但天賦又是什麼?

通常以為是父母遺傳，事實上，很多人具有的天賦和父母毫無關係。
而從佛教角度來看，生命其實有兩套系統，其中的物質系統由父母給予，而精神系統則來自過去生的積累，並將繼續影響未來生命，成為下一輪的起跑點。

從這兩個角度，可以幫助大家理解生命的輪回。
但我們還要看到，輪回不僅體現為一種生命現象，其根源就在我們的心。
佛教認為，眾生在天、人、阿修羅、地獄、餓鬼、畜生六道生生不息地流轉。
這六種生命形態，也代表了我們內心的不同狀態。

比如餓鬼，是貪心發展的極致。
一個貪得無厭的人，會表現出極度的渴求，永無滿足之時，這種心理被無限張揚後，生命所呈現的就是餓鬼狀態。
畜牲，是愚癡無知的狀態，其生命只是停留在本能的需求上，除飲食男女外別無所求，這種生活和那些為覓食、繁衍而忙碌的動物又有什麼區別?阿修羅，是嗔恨狹隘的象徵，他們所熱衷的鬥爭，既是嗔心的體現，又是對嗔心的張揚，當這種心態被固定後，生命就會進入阿修羅的狀態。

可見，生命狀態也是某種心念的延伸，是在成長過程中逐步發展而來。
在社會上，不同行業者往往會

表現出不同的行儀，學者有學者的氣質，商人有商人的風采。
這些差別，正是由不同的心行外化而來，是心念由內而外的延伸。
包括輪回，也是內心發展的一個結果，不是誰強加於我們的。
同樣，佛菩薩的生命品質亦非本然如是。
他們所具有的無限智慧和慈悲，都是在生命發展過程中逐步造就，逐步開發的。

生命的未來在哪里?我們的歸宿在哪里?答案就在我們當下的心行，就看我們現在做了什麼，想了什麼。
現在生命的形態，來自過去生的積累。
未來的生命發展，又來自今生的積累。
所以，佛教非常注重當下的努力，這是銜接過去和未來的關鍵，也是我們改變命運的著力點。

如果不了解生從何來，生命是沒有根的;如果不了解死往何去，生命是沒有歸宿感的。
一個找不到根和歸宿的人，自然會缺乏安全感，這也是現代人極為普遍的一種心理。
如何獲得安全感?很多人是通過積聚財富或購買保險來解決。
事實上，在災難頻仍、風雲變幻的今天，這些保障又是多麼脆弱，多麼不堪一擊呵。
讓向外尋求的心回到當下吧，因為真正的安全感不在別處，就在我們此刻的心行。
我們能夠把握當下，就能把握未來，把握生命走向。
當我們有能力把握這一切的時候，還有什麼不安，還有什麼可以恐慌的呢?

## 肆 何為命運

人有沒有命運?又是由誰來決定這一切?其他宗教多認為，命運是由外在的主宰神或某種神秘力量決定。
而佛教認為，命運就是生命發展的規律，決定這種規律的力量仍在我們自身。
換言之，命運體現了生命發展的因果，是以不同心行作為因而導致的結果。
有什麼樣的行為，就會導致什麼樣的命運走向。
這些行為，包括身、口、意三業。
其中，身業是所行，語業是所說，意業是所想。

佛教還認為，這些由所行、所說、所想構成的因果，貫穿著過去、現在、未來三世。
但現代人很難接受這一觀念，或者說，很難發自內心地引起共鳴。
所以，我現在主要提倡的是心靈因果，當下因果。

我們可以暫時不考慮三世因果，但無法回避心靈因果，當下因果。
當我們行善，或只是生起一念善心時，由此感得的樂果未必立即現前，但由此帶來的內心喜樂卻是當下就能體會的。
我們所有做過、想過的事，都會在內心留下痕跡，形成力量。
這種力量，正是影響未來生命走向的因。
因為心念會形成習慣，並逐步固定為心態，進而導致不同性格，導致不同人格。

每個人的內心都有很多不同心念在活動，其中有正面的，也有負面的，區別只是在於各自力量的強弱。
如果不加選擇地任其發展，很可能就被“我執”掌控，被“我執”發展的負面力量佔據主動。
俗話說:“人不為己，天誅地滅。
”因為“我執”就是我們的本能，是我們不假思索就會維護的本能。
修行的意義，則在於幫助我們調整方向，幫助我們由被動轉為主動，有選擇地強化某些正面心理，淡化並逐步根除某些負面心理。

習慣從哪里來?無非就是某件事我們做多了，想多了，以致成為自然。
比如，我們習慣於每天見到哪些人，習慣於每天做些什麼，習慣於每天吃些什麼。
一旦這種習慣固定下來，就會逐步發展為某種生命模式，成為我們的性格。
所以說，性格就是習慣的積累，又會逐步發展為我們的人格，發展為我們的生命品質。
觀察一下就會發現，我們現在的許多性格，其實是和生活習慣密不可分的。

這些習慣和性格，又決定了命運的不同走向。
所以說，命運不是上天的賜予，不是偶然的機遇，而是由我們自己所設定，是由不同行為所決定。
這種決定命運的因素，佛教稱之為“業力”。
所謂業，又可看做我們的生命程式。
造作地獄之因，就是編寫進入地獄的程式。
種下人天善因，就是編寫進入人天善道的程式。
我們編寫不同的程式，就會進入不同的世界、不同的生命軌道。
所以，我們要改變命運，也要從改變心行程序做起。
如果我們有能力改變心行，改變習慣，就有能力改變命運。
反之，如果無法改變現有的性格和習慣，那改變命運不過是空話而已。

我們的心具有兩個特點:一是選擇，二是創造。
這也是人之所以為萬物之靈的關鍵所在。
桌子不會選擇，房子不會選擇，動物的選擇能力也相對較弱。
而人具有理性，具有抽象思維，不僅能選擇、判斷，還能在選擇、判斷後進行創造。
也正因為這兩大特點，人類才創造了五千年文明。
而在改造世界的同時，自身命運也隨之發展。
從這個角度來說，心就是命運的主宰。

但在很多時候，某些行為一旦形成習慣，心就會不知不覺地進入慣性軌道，被其所控，不是我們想改變就能輕易改變的。
這就必須借助修行來調整，事實上，這正是修行的難度所在。
因為習慣是由日積月累而來，有著根深蒂固的力量。
這種力量，就像地球引力將我們固定在地球上一樣，使我們難以超越，難以擺脫當下的凡夫狀態。

曾經有位教授說要學佛，但起因卻是為了戒煙。
因為他抽煙三十年，尼古丁對其有很強的控制力，可他又檢查出肺部病變。
醫生警告說:再抽煙馬上完蛋。
他當然珍愛生命，但每天要和尼古丁的誘惑進行鬥爭，身心俱疲，就希望通過學佛來解決這一問題。

這一理由固然有些可笑，但卻說明，習慣一旦形成，對身心都有極大的控制力，若不痛下決心，是很難加以改變的。
除了決心，我們還應瞭解生命發展的規律。
依循這一規律，才能切實地規劃未來，改變命運。

## 伍 活著為什麼

人為什麼活著?活著的價值是什麼?也是每個人無法回避的重要問題。

活著爲什麽做任何事，我們都會有某種理由。
因為餓了，所以要吃飯;因為困了，所以要睡覺;因為孤獨，所以要尋找感情。
活著，難道不更需要理由嗎?一般人找個理由似乎不難，比如說，為了我的孩子，為了我的家庭，為了我的事業，因為他們對人生沒有太多思考，隨便找個理由都可以打發自己。
但深入思考的話，我們就很難滿足於這樣的答案，滿足於這種人云亦云的價值觀。
所以，那些有思想的人反而不容易找到活著的理由，因為世人所認可的那些理由都是經不起推敲的。
對某些人固然重要，對某些人卻可有可無;又或者，在生命某個階段顯得重要，但在另外階段卻毫無價值。
可見，這些都不是我們找尋的終極答案。
也正因為如此，不少藝術家或哲學家甚至會苦悶到走上絕路。
因為對某些注重精神生活的人來說，如果找不到具有說服力的理由，就很難心安理得地過下去。
從更深一層來看，多數人所追求的人生價值，更經不起死亡的審視。
再大的事業，再多的財富，在死亡面前，都像泡沫般脆弱短暫。
當事業結束時，為我們的生命留下什麼?回顧歷史，哪怕貴為帝王，稱霸一時，同樣是灰飛煙滅。
所以，外在一切都是要過去的。
當這些成為回憶，給生命帶來什麼影響，才是我們真正應該重視的。

孟子說:“人人皆可為堯舜。
”佛教則認為，每個生命都具有潛在的、佛菩薩那樣的高尚品質，也就是眾生本具的佛性。
我們的心固然會製造種種煩惱，但同時也具備解除煩惱的能力。
若不開發這一能力，輪回將永無止境，因為無明就是製造痛苦的永動機，使我們在苦海中沉淪輾轉，迷失方向。

活著的意義，在於瞭解並開發自身潛在的高尚品質。
惟有這樣，我們才有能力完成生命版本的升級，才有能力給眾生究竟而長久的幫助，這正是佛教所說的自覺覺他，自利利他。

佛教認為，人生是由惑業苦組成。
因為無明障蔽，使我們看不清生命真相。
不知何為幸福，就會以苦為樂，與幸福背道而馳。
不知我是誰，就會非我執我，遺患無窮。
不知生從何來，死往何去，不知何為命運，就無法對未來作出正確規劃，使生命健康發展。
不知活著為什麼，就會耽著於眼前小利而忽略生命的究竟價值，或因找不到活著的正當理由而失去生存動力。
因此，探討和解決這些永恆的問題，對人生的究竟幸福具有重大意義。

愿以此功德，普及于一切，
我等與衆生，皆共成佛道。
